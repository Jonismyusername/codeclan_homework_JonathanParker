# 
# Question 1.
# 
# Load in the libraries you need, and look at the backpack data. Take note of variable names and dimensions.
#

view(backpack)
names(backpack)
dim(backpack)
```


```{r}
# Question 2.
# 
# What is the distribution of backpack weights that students are carrying? Choose an appropriate graph to show the distribution.
#

ggplot(backpack) +
  aes(x = backpack_weight) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, col = "white") 

# Summary
# The chart shows that the vast majority of backpacks fall within the weight range 10-15.
```


```{r}
# Question 3.
# 
# Are there differences in backpack weight between sex?
#

ggplot(backpack) +
  aes(x = backpack_weight, y = sex) +
  geom_point()

# Summary
# No discernible differences in backpack weight between sex, with the exception
# one outlying male value (35).
```


```{r}
# Question 4.
# 
# What is the relationship between body weight and backpack weight?
#

ggplot(backpack) +
  aes(x = backpack_weight, y = body_weight) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,30))

# Summary
# There is a weak positive correlation between backpack weight and body weight.
# Removing the outlying value for backpack weight (35) weakens this correlation
# further.
```


```{r}
# Question 5.
# 
# Is this relationship different between men and women? Choose an appropriate plot and interpret your findings.
#


ggplot(backpack) +
  aes(x = backpack_weight, y = body_weight) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_grid(~ sex)

# Summary
# The weak positive correlation applies to both male and female students.
```


```{r}
# Question 6.
# 
# What proportion of students report back pain?
#

backpack %>% 
  mutate(back_problems = as.logical(back_problems)) %>% 
ggplot() +
  aes(x = "", y = "", fill = back_problems) +
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  facet_grid(~ sex)
  
  
# Summary
#
```


```{r}
# Question 7.
# 
# Is this proportion different between men and women?
#



# Summary
#
```


```{r}
# Question 8.
# 
# Now youâ€™ve investigated your data separately, create plots to describe the relationship between backpack weight, body weight, gender and reported backpain.
# 
# Try both backpack_weight and body_weight as well as the ratio.
# 
# Hint: faceting would be useful here.

# Summary
